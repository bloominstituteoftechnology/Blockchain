BLOCKCHAIN
    what is a blockchain?
    basically another data structure
    offers trust that no one could have tampered with the data inside the blockchain

    kind of like a linked list
    very often may want to use a linkedlist to make one
    want to know the relationship between each block
    [block] -> [block] -> [block]

    inside the block:
        index, timestamp, transactions <- actual data,
        a proof: just a number, but an important one
        will also need hash of the previous block

        hash(block string + proof) = some value, usually 0's in the beginning
