# block chain note?
# holds info for ledgers of data/ transactions etc..
# allows us  once given data structure making it unable to be broken down easily and adapted as each step needs the previous step's info as part of the next block.j

# like a linked list... each block has a relationship to next block...

# EACH BLOCK

# NEEDS TO STORE:
# INDEX
# TIME STAMP-WHEN CREATED
# WHAT IT'S STORING- AKA .VALUE OR TRANSACTION
# PROOF= a number... an important one... "proof of work" is proof that we spent the time doing the labor of mining the blocks... hash with a certain amount of zeros at the start.
#   "block string" + "proof (aka some number)" and take that and hash it... making the proof of work = 000A1L6.....
# THE HASH OF THE PREVIOUS BLOCK
# NEEDS THE ITEMS WITH 3# MOST


# the longest chain is the winner and its a race to get there
